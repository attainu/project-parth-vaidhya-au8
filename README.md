# How game runs:

1.	As soon as you start,  the game tells you the rules and asks the name of 2 players.

2.	As the user inputs both names the game prompts player-1 to press Enter to roll the dice.

3.	One’s dice rolls and displays numbers the player moves forward and the same happens with player-2.

4.	If a player reaches a number with a ladder it climbs up whereas if there’s a snake on that number the player gets down.

5.	First player to reach 100 wins the game.
